# Campus_Recruitment_Prediction_LLM
Building an classification model to check whether a candidate get placed in a campus recruitment or not. The previous work of using ML Models to classify recruitment is available [here](https://github.com/Kirushikesh/Campus_Recruitment_Prediction) but LLM era starts so i upgraded to this project to finetune an LLM for classification task.
